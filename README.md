## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learned about how to add gradients to elements in CSS, it was fairly simple but it adds more pop to a lot of the boxes!




```css
.results{
    display:flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    background-image: linear-gradient(180deg,hsl(252, 100%, 65%),hsl(252, 100%, 35%) ) ;
    max-height: 330px;
    text-align: center;
    margin:0;
    border-radius: 28px;
    padding: 48px;   
}
```



**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I hope to be able to understand a bit more on aliging texts a certain way. Maybe something along one axis?
